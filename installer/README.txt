Verily is a web framework for Java that supports the development of verifiable web applications.
Rather than requiring that programs be verified in separate a posteriori analysis, Verily supports
construction via a series of Recipes, which are properties of an application that are enforced at compile time.

Verily Release Coming Soon!
